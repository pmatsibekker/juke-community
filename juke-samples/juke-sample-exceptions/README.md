# juke-sample-exceptions

A demo of how Juke handles **exception and latency flows**. A shopper buys a product; the order
service places **three orders** with an external Order Management System (OMS) reached through a
`@Juke` seam. The same journey is driven **four times** to show record, deterministic replay, an
injected delay, and an injected exception — all without changing a line of application code.

```

Each order produces a **5-second confirmation popup**. Coverage statistics live in a **separate
popup** (the "View test coverage" button), deliberately kept off the ordering screen.

## The four runs

| Run | Mode | What happens | UI result |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Record | Global record mode captures the 3 OMS calls into `order-demo.zip` | 3 × **COMPLETED** popups |
| **2** | Replay (per-session) | The recorded receipts replay deterministically | 3 × **COMPLETED**, same OMS order ids as run 1 |
| **3** | Replay + **delay** | Remix injects a 10s delay on the **2nd** order; the client times out at 4s | order 2 → **"Your order is queued"**, orders 1 & 3 complete |
| **4** | Replay + **exception** | Remix injects an `IOException` on the **2nd** order; the service catches it | order 2 → **"We are experiencing technical difficulties…"**, orders 1 & 3 complete |

The Playwright spec (`order-flow.spec.ts`) drives all four in one headed, slowed-down browser so
you can watch every popup, then opens the coverage popup and holds the drill-down report on screen
for >10 seconds.

## What this sample is for

| Question | Where to look |
|---|---|
| How does Juke replay a fault on **one specific call**? | Remix `delaySchedule` / `exceptionSchedule` on `IOrderManagementSystem.submitOrder.2`; the spec derives that id at runtime from `GET /service/recording/inputs` |
| How do I keep a **non-deterministic field** from breaking replay? | The confirmation number is generated fresh per attempt and marked `@JukeIgnorable` on `OmsOrderRequest`; the run-2 session report stays `COMPLETED` even though the number differs every run |
| Why is "queued" handled **client-side**? | A `@Juke` call must stay on the HTTP request thread (the replay/session context is request-scoped), so the server can't offload it to time out. The SPA's axios timeout (4s) detects the slow 2nd order and shows "queued"; the confirmation number is client-generated so it's available even before the server responds |
| What does the **graceful exception** path look like? | `OrderService.placeOrder` catches the OMS failure and returns `status: RECORDED` — the customer still gets their confirmation number and a "recorded for later" message |
| What gets **excluded** from coverage? | `IOrderManagementSystem → OrderManagementSystemImpl` (the displaced `@Juke` seam impl), shown under "@Juke seams excluded" in the coverage popup |

## Run it

### 1. Build (one time)

From the **repo root**:

```bash
mvn -pl juke-samples/juke-sample-exceptions -am package -Pcoverage -DskipTests
```

> The `-Pcoverage` profile is **required** — it builds the React bundle with `vite-plugin-istanbul`
> so the SPA exposes `window.__coverage__` for the UI half of the coverage popup. A plain
> `mvn package` ships a fast, uninstrumented bundle. The bundle is emitted straight into
> `target/classes/static`, so `mvn clean` always wipes stale output.

### 2. Start the server

From inside `juke-samples\juke-sample-exceptions\`:

| Shell | Command |
|---|---|
| **cmd.exe** | `demo-start-server.bat` |
| **PowerShell** | `.\demo-start-server.ps1` &nbsp; *(the `.\` is required)* |
| **Explorer** | Double-click `demo-start-server.bat`, or right-click `.ps1` → "Run with PowerShell" |

The script locates JDK 25, attaches the JaCoCo agent, turns on `juke.coverage.enabled=true`, and
launches the jar with `juke.enabled=true`, `juke.path=~/juke-demo/sample-exceptions`, and
`juke.zip=order-demo`.

### 3. Open the browser

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Pick a product, click **Buy**, and watch three orders process with a 5-second popup each. Click
**View test coverage** for the coverage popup (Summary tab → server + UI bars and the excluded
seam; **Coverage report** tab → the JaCoCo drill-down).

### 4. Drive all four runs automatically

In a **second** terminal, from inside `juke-samples\juke-sample-exceptions\`:

| Shell | Command |
|---|---|
| **cmd.exe** | `demo-run-playwright.bat` |
| **PowerShell** | `.\demo-run-playwright.ps1` |

Chrome opens headed and slowed down; the four runs play out in sequence, then the coverage popup
opens and the report is held on screen. UI coverage is harvested into `~/juke-demo/coverage/ui/`
so the popup's UI half fills in.

> **Headless / CI:** set `JUKE_HEADLESS=1` to run the spec without a visible browser (the demo is
> headed + `slowMo` by default so it's watchable).

## Juke features this sample exercises

- **`@Juke` on the seam** — records under global record mode (no cookie) and replays
  per-session when a `JUKE_SESSION` cookie is present. One annotation covers both
  (the value defaults to `"juke"`; only the non-default states need an explicit string).
- **Per-session replay + reports** — each replay run is `session/start?track=order-demo&description=…`
  → drive → `session/stop`; `GET /service/recording/report?track=order-demo` shows one session per run.
- **`@JukeIgnorable`** — the changing confirmation number is skipped in the replay input-diff, so
  the report reads `COMPLETED` (not `COMPLETED_WITH_DEVIATIONS`).
- **Remix fault injection** — `delaySchedule` (10s) and `exceptionSchedule` (`IOException`) on the
  2nd order, with `GET /service/remix/clear` between runs so faults don't compound.
- **Functional coverage** — `/service/coverage` (server JaCoCo + UI nyc), with the OMS impl
  auto-excluded as a `@Juke` seam.

On a full four-run journey, server line coverage lands around **70%** and UI lines around **90%**;
the coverage popup's badge turns green once both halves cross their thresholds.

> Why not 100%? `OrderService.cancelOrder` / `reconcile` (admin ops) and `AboutPanel.jsx` (footer
> link) are deliberately never exercised by the journey, so the gate stays meaningful.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`record/start` / remix returns "Unavailable Service" (500):** the server got stuck in a
  passthrough state. Restart it; a fresh start is in `IGNORE` mode and all control endpoints work.
- **Coverage popup's UI half is empty:** you built without `-Pcoverage`, or no Playwright run has
  produced the nyc report yet. Rebuild with `-Pcoverage` and run `demo-run-playwright`.
- **Rebuilt the framework but the change isn't taking effect:** `spring-boot:repackage` is
  incremental — run `mvn clean package` (not bare `package`) so the fat jar re-embeds the updated
  dependency. See [`../LESSONS_LEARNED.md`](../LESSONS_LEARNED.md).
